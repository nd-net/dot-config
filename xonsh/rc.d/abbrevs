# Command abbreviations.
#
# This expands input words from `abbrevs` disctionary as you type.
# Adds ``abbrevs`` dictionary to hold user-defined "command abbreviations.
# The dictionary is searched as you type the matching words are replaced at the command line by the corresponding dictionary contents once you hit 'Space' or 'Return' key.
# 
# For instance a frequently used command such as ``git status`` can be abbreviated to ``gst`` as follows::
#
#     $ xontrib load abbrevs
#     $ abbrevs['gst'] = 'git status'
#     $ gst # Once you hit <space> or <return> 'gst' gets expanded to 'git status'.
#
# one can set a callback function that receives current buffer and word to customize the expanded word based on context
# 
# .. code-block:: python
#
#     $ abbrevs['ps'] = lambda buffer, word: "procs" if buffer.text.startswith(word) else word
#
#
# It is also possible to set the cursor position after expansion with,
#
#     $ abbrevs['gp'] = "git push <edit> --force"
